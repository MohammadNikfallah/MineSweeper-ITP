[Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) is a single-player puzzle game.
Minesweeper rules are very simple. 
> The board is divided into cells, with mines randomly distributed.
> To win, you need to open all the cells. The number on a cell shows the number of mines adjacent to it.
> Using this information, you can determine cells that are safe, and cells that contain mines.
> Cells suspected of being mines can be marked with a flag
